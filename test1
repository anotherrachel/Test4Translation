##Millenial loning
千禧一代的消费观

#Firms are gradually adpating to the tastes of younger consumers
各大公司渐渐开始迎合年轻消费者的口味

OLDER people are not the only ones to try too hard to be hip and youthful. Long-established firms can, too. Just look at Procter & Gamble (P&G), one of the world’s largest consumer-goods firms, which this year applied to America’s federal patent office to trademark LOL, NBD, WTF and FML, abbreviations commonly used in text messages and social media. If it succeeds, the 181-year-old firm plans to use the phrases to market soap, cleaners and air fresheners to young buyers. Its move is the intellectual-property equivalent of Dad dancing. But it is a sign of large firms’ eagerness to woo millennial consumers.
不仅是老年人在努力赶时髦保持青春活力，百年老店亦是如此。跻身全球最大日用消费品公司之列的宝洁公司，今年向美国联邦专利局申请了LOL、 NBD、WTF以及FML等商标，这些缩写常见于短信及社交媒体中。如果申请成功，这家有着181年历史的公司将使用这些词汇向年轻消费者推广肥皂、清洁剂以及空气清新剂。此举好似知识产权老爸尬舞，但却表明大公司们在努力迎合千禧一代的消费者。
To many firms they are a mystery. KPMG, a consultancy, reckons nearly half do not know how millennials—typically defined as those born between 1980 and 2000—differ from their older counterparts. That may be because such differences are overblown. According to Ipsos-MORI, a pollster, millennials are “the most carelessly described group we have ever looked at”. Many claims about them are simplified or wrong. It is often said, for example, that they ignore conventional ads; in fact they are heavily influenced by marketing.

Given such misconceptions, it is little wonder that firms sometimes get it wrong. In February, MillerCoors, an American brewer, released Two Hats, a light fruit-flavoured brew the beer-maker said would suit millennials’ tastes and budgets (tagline: “Good, cheap beer. Wait, what?”). Consumers just waited; the beer was pulled from shelves after six months. But some stereotypes about millennials have roots in reality. Companies are finding that three broad approaches do succeed when trying to sell to them: transparency, experiences (over things) and flexibility.
